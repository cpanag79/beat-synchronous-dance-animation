# Beat synchronous dance animation

Beat Synchronous Dance Animation based on Analysis of Periodic Motion given the music Tempo.

Matlab Code: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54298-beat-synchronous-dance-animation

This code is a simple implementation of Beat Synchronous Dance Animation based on Periodic Motion and Music Tempo Analysis
based on the paper [1].

The goal of the proposed method [1] is to generate beat synchronous dance animation (bvh format) based on the analysis of both visual and audio data.
We propose and employ a new method for the temporal segmentation of such motion
data into the periods of dance. Next, we use a beats of audio. Given an
input music with its beats that is of the same genre as the one corresponding to the
visually observed dance, we automatically produce a beat synchronous
dance animation of a virtual character.

It uses the toolboxes
MOCAP0p136 from http://motor-invariant-control.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BVH/MOCAP0p136/
and NDLUTIL0p162 from https://github.com/XinweiJiang/SLLGPLVM/tree/master/NDLUTIL0p162
